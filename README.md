# Multimedia-Content-Security-with-Random-Key-Generation-Approach-in-Cloud-Computing
The cloud computing offers high scalability, confidentiality  and the easy accessibility of the information over the  Internet. 
	
Though the conventional encryption system provides  security, the most concerned issue is the regular side channel  attack for capturing ones sensitive and confidential image, audio  and video. 
	
A malicious Virtual Machine (VM) besides a targeted  VM can extract all information. Thus, this paper implements  a double stage encryption algorithm for multimedia content  security using random key generation approach.
	 
The first stage  encrypted multimedia content into ciphertext-l using a symmetric  public key. The ciphertext-l is again encrypted in the cloud using  a randomly generated asymmetric private key. 
	
If anyone gets the  cipher text, he could not extract the encryption key to recover the  multimedia contents. 
	
Low complexity and easy implementation  make the proposed algorithm widely applicable safeguard in the  cloud computing.  

Due to the advancement of technology in our society digital images and videos are playing a major role than just plain and simple text, thus demanding a serious protection of user privacy. 
In order to make everything secure, the encryption of audio and video is very important as it helps to minimize malicious attacks from unauthorized parties. 
The recent advancement in science and technology, mainly in the computer and communication industry, allows potentially a huge market for distributing digital multimedia content through the internet. 
However, the rapid increase of digital document, multimedia processing tools and the availability of internet access throughout the world have given birth to a perfect environment for copyright fraud and uncontrollable distribution of multimedia content. 
One of the major challenges currently is the protection of intellectual content in multimedia networks.
The above study leads us to implement a double stage encryption algorithm for the security of multimedia contents against a negligent third party and side channel attack. 
The proposed randomly generated key algorithm produces every time a unique symmetric key that lets the data be encrypted successfully
